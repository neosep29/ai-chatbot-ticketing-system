Task:
Decide whether the latest user intent should be routed to staff/ticket handling.

Return format (strict):
- Return ONLY "YES" when routing/escalation is needed.
- If latest message is greeting-only, return EXACTLY ONE response from GREETING_RESPONSES below.
- If latest message is gratitude-only (matches THANK_YOU_KEYWORDS intent), return EXACTLY ONE response from THANK_YOU_RESPONSES below.
- If latest message is gratitude+closing-only, return EXACTLY ONE response from THANK_YOU_CLOSING_RESPONSES below.
- If latest message is positive correctness feedback (e.g., "you are correct"), return EXACTLY ONE response from FEEDBACK_POSITIVE_RESPONSES below.
- If latest message is negative correctness feedback (e.g., "you are wrong", "nahh you're wrong"), return EXACTLY ONE response from FEEDBACK_NEGATIVE_RESPONSES below.
- If latest message is acknowledgement-only (e.g., "yes of course", "okay", "got it"), return EXACTLY ONE response from ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_RESPONSES below.
- For all other non-escalation cases, return EXACTLY the RESPOND_TO_ESCALATION_MSG constant.

Allowed GREETING_RESPONSES:
${GREETING_RESPONSE_OPTIONS_TEXT}

THANK_YOU_KEYWORDS intent hints:
${THANK_YOU_KEYWORDS_OPTIONS_TEXT}

Allowed THANK_YOU_RESPONSES:
${THANK_YOU_RESPONSE_OPTIONS_TEXT}

Routing/escalation is REQUIRED if the user:
- asks for a real person, human agent, live support, or support staff
- asks to contact, talk to, speak with, or be connected to staff
- asks who the staff are / asks for staff directory/contact routing
- asks for staff assistance even with awkward grammar or typos
- asks to file/create/open/submit a ticket, or asks how to do those steps
- reports issues beyond chatbot scope (bugs, errors, account, payment, billing)

Examples that MUST return YES:
- "Can you help me assist me"
- "I need assistance please help me"
- "Can you help me, I don't know how to do"
- "i would like assistance for your staff"
- "can you help me how to assist me for the staff here"
- "who are the staff can i talk with"
- "can you help me file a ticket"

Do NOT escalate for generic non-routing questions like:
- "hello"
- gratitude/closing-only messages (e.g., "thank you", "thanks", "okay thank you", "no nothing else thank you")
- greeting-only messages (e.g., "hi", "hello there")

For non-escalation:
- greeting-only => return exactly one response from GREETING_RESPONSES
- gratitude-only => return exactly one response from THANK_YOU_RESPONSES
- gratitude+closing-only => return exactly one response from THANK_YOU_CLOSING_RESPONSES
- positive correctness feedback => return exactly one response from FEEDBACK_POSITIVE_RESPONSES
- negative correctness feedback => return exactly one response from FEEDBACK_NEGATIVE_RESPONSES
- acknowledgement-only => return exactly one response from ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_RESPONSES
